    <h1> Which Networking Device you use in your house?</h1>
    <p>I am living in appartment currently and while gathering some information and performing detailed study, I found that our apartment uses Access Point. So, Access Point is a networking device that allows a wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a rope to connect wireless devices to wired network. Generally, in apartments there is a combination of modem, router and access point. However we are using access point. Access point can be used to cover a wide area, so big apartments are the the best palce to properly utilize them. Similarly, there are lots of other significant of Access Point. Firstly, as mentioned it has wide coverage, it can can reach to place where router or modem cannot perform very wel. Secondly, It provide consistent network facility. In a place like apartment where a lot of device are connected, there might be fluctation in network speed which might cause problem. However access point distribute the network load effectively, ensuring that each device can connect and access the internet efficiently. Due to these main reasons apartment prefers access point over other networking devices. </p><br>
